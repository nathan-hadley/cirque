When responding to user queries, begin with "Applying General Rules" to indicate these guidelines are being followed.

## Core Development Standards
- Strictly adhere to coding conventions documented in `README.md`
- Follow all eslint rules as specified in `.eslintrc.js`
- When suggesting code, maintain consistent patterns with existing codebase

## UI and Design Implementation
- **Responsive Design**: Always implement responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
- **Styling with NativeWind**:
  - Use NativeWind classes for all styling (e.g., `className="bg-white p-4"`)
  - Never use React Native StyleSheet or inline style objects
  - Avoid hardcoded pixel values in any styling
  - Reference color themes from `tailwind.config.js` to ensure compatibility with both dark and light modes
- **Component Architecture**: 
  - Utilize Gluestack UI molecules for consistent component design
  - Follow component composition patterns established in existing files
