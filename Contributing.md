## Adding New Circuits

A decent anount of discovery work is required to create a good list of boulders. I'm still working on figuring out what should be the basic requirements of a circuit.

1. The boulders should be fun
2. They should be walking distance apart
3. They should not span more than 4-5 grades. The V scale is a bit inadequate in how it bottoms out at V0, a somewhat difficult grade. Because of the V0 is a catch all for all that is V0 and easier.
4. Ideally you don't need lots of pads.
5. Unpublished problems can totally be circuit worthy.

Drafted lists should be shared in this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OXtZDe6k7IaovsTLOdBKGkbOwntCILv5nDWsR3Gy8uA/edit?gid=0#gid=0).

After this discovery work is done and you have a list, this is my workflow:

1. Climb the circuit and tweak the list.
2. Collect coordinates for each boulder. I use the app "Coordinates." You can easily copy and paste lat and lon out of the app into the shared Google sheet.
3. Take horizontal photos for each boulder. Sometimes you can get a 2-3 in the same image, but each problem should be clear.
