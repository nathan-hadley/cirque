# Cirque

After a trip to Fontainebleau, France, I was inspired to bring their concept of bouldering circuits to Leavenworth. This app will allow the creation and sharing of circuits. We are starting with one V0-V3 Swiftwater circuit but more will be added soon.

## Adding New Circuits

A decent anount of discovery work is required to create a good list of boulders. I'm still working on figuring out what should be the basic requirements of a circuit.

1. The boulders should be fun
2. They should be walking distance apart
3. They should not span more than 4-5 grades. The V scale is a bit inadequate in how it bottoms out at V0, a somewhat difficult grade. Because of the V0 is a catch all for all that is V0 and easier.
4. Ideally you don't need lots of pads.
5. Unpublished problems can totally be circuit worthy.

After this discovery work is done and you have a list, this is my workflow:
